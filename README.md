This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Introduction

This is my NBA Stat project. Below you will find helpful instructions and images detailing its functionality.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Examples

#### Search

Search by player last name. Partial completion will work. Produces list of results with clickable names that lead to player data.

#### Player Data

Again, this page is routed when you select a player from the list produced by a search. This displays season average of main stats (points, rebounds and assists). Additionally, it generates a graph that shows per game performance. This page is interactable by selecting the year dropdown and choosing a year. The page will dynamically update utilizing React's use effect function.
